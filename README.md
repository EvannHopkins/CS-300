# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem we were solving in the projects for this course was handling and managing course data efficiently. The goal was to read course information from a file, store it in a data structure, and provide various functionalities to interact with and display the course data. This problem required us to implement functionalities like reading and parsing data from a file, sorting and organizing course information, and providing a user-friendly menu interface for interacting with the data.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I first identified the key components and operations required for the project, such as reading data from a file, creating course objects, sorting and displaying course information, and providing a user menu. I recognized the importance of choosing appropriate data structures for each task. Data structures are crucial because they determine how efficiently we can perform operations on the data. For example, using a hash table for storing course objects allows for efficient retrieval and modification based on unique course numbers. Similarly, using a sorting algorithm like MergeSort helps organize the data for display.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the project, I encountered challenges such as selecting the most suitable data structure and designing efficient algorithms. To overcome these roadblocks, I thoroughly reviewed the requirements of each task and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of different data structures and algorithms. I researched and experimented with different approaches, seeking guidance from course materials, online resources, and discussions with peers or instructors. Iterative testing and debugging were also crucial in identifying and resolving issues.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project expanded my approach to designing software by highlighting the significance of modularization and separation of concerns. Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable procedures allowed for clearer code organization and easier maintenance. It also emphasized the importance of planning and designing before diving into implementation. Additionally, working on this project helped me understand the value of abstraction and encapsulation, as encapsulating functionalities within procedures and objects enhanced code readability and reusability.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project reinforced the importance of writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By adopting a modular approach, I learned to create well-defined procedures with clear inputs, outputs, and functionality. This practice contributes to code maintainability and makes it easier for future developers (including myself) to understand and modify the code. Writing meaningful variable and function names, providing comments, and adhering to coding conventions improved code readability. The experience of designing a menu-driven interface and structuring the project logically also underscored the significance of adaptability, as the project needed to accommodate potential future changes or additions seamlessly.
